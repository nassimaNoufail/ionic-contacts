# ionic-contacts

A super simple contact management app I used to learn the Ionic framework.

## Features

View a list of your contacts:

Pressing the X icon deletes the contact. Pressing the + icon at the bottom of the screen takes the user to the Add Contact page:
[add contact image]
The Add Contact and Home pages of the app communicate via Ionic's event framework.


Tapping a contact's icon brings up a modal where you can choose a new icon for that contact:

If I were to make this into a fully-functional app, I would write a backend that exposes a REST API and allows the contacts to be stored in a database.
